# PocketBase + Replited Example

This directory contains an example of how to use `replited` as a sidecar for `pocketbase` to create a primary-replica setup.

## How to run

1.  **Start the services:**
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

2.  **Access the primary PocketBase:**
    Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8090/_/](http://localhost:8090/_/). You can create some data on the primary.

3.  **Access the replica PocketBase:**
    Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8091/_/](http://localhost:8091/_/). The data you created on the primary should be replicated here. The replica is read-only.

4.  **Check the replication data:**
    The `data/replited` directory contains the replication files generated by `replited`.

5.  **Stop the services:**
    ```sh
    docker-compose down
    ```
